# API Directory

This directory is intended to house all API-related files and functions for the React Native and Supabase project. It serves as a central location for managing the interactions between the app and Supabase, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

## Structure

As the project evolves, this directory will be populated with various files and subdirectories. Below is an example of how you might structure your API directory:

```
api/
├── auth/
│   ├── login.ts
│   ├── logout.ts
│   ├── register.ts
├── user/
│   ├── getUserProfile.ts
│   ├── updateUserProfile.ts
├── data/
│   ├── fetchData.ts
│   ├── sendData.ts
```

### `auth/`
This subdirectory contains files related to authentication, such as logging in, logging out, and registering users.

### `user/`
This subdirectory contains files related to user-specific operations, such as fetching and updating user profiles.

### `data/`
This subdirectory contains files related to data operations, such as fetching and sending data to the Supabase backend.

## Usage

Each file within these subdirectories will export functions that interact with Supabase. Here's an example of what a simple API function might look like:

### Example: `fetchData.ts`

```typescript
import { supabase } from '../supabaseClient';

/**
 * Fetch data from the specified table in Supabase
 * @param {string} table - The name of the table to fetch data from
 * @returns {Promise<Object[]>} - The data from the table
 */
export async function fetchData(table: string): Promise<object[] | null> {
  try {
    let { data, error } = await supabase
      .from(table)
      .select('*');
    if (error) {
      throw error;
    }
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Setup

Before using any API functions, ensure that your Supabase client is properly initialized. Typically, this setup is done in a separate configuration file (`supabaseClient.ts`), which you can import into your API files.

### Example: `supabaseClient.ts`

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl: string = 'https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co';
const supabaseAnonKey: string = 'your-supabase-anon-key';

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

## Contributing

When contributing to this directory, please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Follow the existing file and directory structure.
- Ensure that all functions are well-documented with JSDoc comments.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Test your functions thoroughly before committing.
